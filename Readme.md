Drunken Gridworld! Agent tries to arive home with at least one drink in them. However, navigating becomes increasingly wobbly as the agent becomes more drunk.
Bars are on the way home, as well as a perilous pond. Based off of the pymdp Gridworld tutorials:
https://github.com/infer-actively/pymdp/blob/master/examples/gridworld_tutorial_2.ipynb

generative_model.py contains the active inference model and the world state object
game.py contains graphics code, and start_multiprocessing.py ties them together.

To run the model, run "python start_multiprocessing.py"
